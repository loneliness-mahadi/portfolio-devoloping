            </h3>
            <p>
                My name is Mahadi Hasan. I am from Jamalpur. Now I live in Mirpur. Now I read in CST in Saic Institute
                Of Management & Tecnology. Although I am a nub now, it will take me a few more days to make myself a
                pro. I'm not saying I need to hire you now but if you think I need you, you can hire me.
            </p>

                    Even after turning off the lights, a soft red glow of the big digital clock spreads in my room, just
                    as
                    soft as your touch. As the clock ticks, the level of playing psychedelic rock on the earphones also
                    increases. Sometimes I wake up at three in the morning, it's too bad, it's nostalgic. The ticking of
                    the
                    clock took me to four in the morning, the time I was born. The veranda next to the house, the ugly
                    satellite at four in the morning doesn't look ugly anymore, the life that keeps pace with the
                    ticking of
                    the clock doesn't look ugly anymore. Who knows! Somewhere in the distance, maybe the sorrows of a
                    young
                    man are flying in the air like smoke. I'm fine, so is the wall clock. She goes ahead to bring a new
                    day,
                    I go to the porch to see her face.
